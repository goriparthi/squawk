# Squawk

A native macOS floating dock for approving agent tool calls without switching to
the terminal. Swift 6, AppKit, no package dependencies.

This file is the institutional knowledge for the repo: conventions, commands,
architecture, and the mistakes that have actually bitten. Read it before
changing anything.

## Commands

```sh
make test          # offline unit suite. Must be green before any commit.
make smoke         # end to end: real hook binary against a stand in app
make bundle        # assemble dist/Squawk.app
make run           # install to ~/Applications and launch
make install-hook  # register the PreToolUse hook, backing up settings.json
```

`swift build` needs only the Command Line Tools. XCTest needs Xcode, which is
why `make test` sets `DEVELOPER_DIR`.

## Architecture

```
app/Sources/SquawkCore/    UI-free: the wire protocol, roster state, tool
                           summaries, hook output JSON, tty validation, sockets
app/Sources/Squawk/        AppKit: the panel, the ring, the detail card, the
                           socket server, pane focus
app/Sources/squawk-hook/   the PreToolUse hook binary, bundled at
                           Contents/Helpers/squawk-hook
app/Tests/                 the offline suite
scripts/smoke.sh           end to end protocol check
```

**Logic belongs in `SquawkCore`.** It is UI-free and therefore testable. If
something in the AppKit layer is worth a test, move it down first.

## The rules that matter

- **The hook fails open, always.** Every error path in `squawk-hook` exits 0
  with no output, which falls through to the normal terminal prompt. An agent
  must never block on a UI that is not running. Any new branch in that binary
  gets the same treatment, and `make smoke` covers it.
- **Never write into a terminal pane.** Squawk selects panes. Injecting
  keystrokes was tried and lands partial lines when the shell is still
  initialising. See `docs/design.md`.
- **A tty is validated, not escaped.** It is interpolated into AppleScript, so
  `PaneFocus.isValidTTY` refuses anything that is not `/dev/tty` plus
  alphanumerics. Do not relax this into an escaping function.
- **An arc expires on the budget its own hook declared** (`waitSeconds`), not on
  a lifetime the app picks. The app used to guess, and an arc that outlived its
  hook let you approve into a closed socket with no feedback.
- **Buttons are `FirstMouseButton`.** The panel is answered while another app
  has focus, so a plain `NSButton` would spend the first click activating the
  window.

## Conventions

- Swift 6 language mode, warning-free.
- No package dependencies. This is a product property, not an accident.
- Comments say why, not what, and stay to two lines.
- No em dashes anywhere: UI copy, comments, commit messages, docs.
- Commit messages: one imperative line, then at most three or four lines of body
  when the why is not obvious. No Claude co-author trailers. No ticket prefixes;
  this is a personal project and does not use Jira.

## Gotchas

- The socket is `~/.squawk/sock`, chmod 0600, because it carries approval
  authority. `sockaddr_un` caps the path at 104 bytes, which `SocketPath`
  checks rather than truncating silently.
- Pane focus needs Automation permission for iTerm2; macOS prompts on first use.
- Verifying a click with synthetic events (`cliclick`, System Events) needs
  Accessibility permission for the calling process. Without it the click is
  dropped silently and looks like an app bug.
